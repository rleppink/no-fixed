# "No fixed"

A very simple WebExtension to block any and all attempts by websites to set 'fixed' or 'sticky' CSS
elements. Those elements usually only serve as a distraction or annoyance reading an article, like:

- Full page modal asking your email address for their newsletter
- Social media buttons or ads that keep scrolling with the content
- Banners asking you to comply with cookie laws 
- Website's menu, logo, header or footer that keeps scrolling with the content - obscuring that 
which you want to read

Example, only half of the article is visible and the social media buttons are worthless:

Super annoying.
